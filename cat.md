  "name": "CatOS",
  "version": "0.3",
  "codename": "IndyCat-Splat",
  "kernel": "IndyCat v1.1 with GPTLayer 1.0, FTLayer 0.1, and Intel GSLayer 1.0",
  "summary": "CatOS 0.3 integrates Intel’s Gaussian Splats into its multiversal workstation pipeline. Real-world graphics can now be rendered in runtime with photorealistic fidelity, blending QuantumFS timelines into visually dense worlds. The GSLayer 1.0 hooks into AI.Web recursion, giving environments live splat-mapped detail across FAT32, ext4, LoROM, and QuantumFS. This upgrade transforms CatOS into not only a drift shell but a holographic renderer for simulations and games. Flames Co. describes it as 'file-first reality projection' — logic, scripts, and configs now spill into splatted light itself."

  "name": "Haltmann OS",
  "version": "1.X-infdev",
  "codename": "IndyCat-Origin",
  "kernel": "CatKernel v0.1 with GPTLayer, Codex hooks, Grok recursion, Markdown-spec pipeline, and LightFS photon layer",
  "summary": "Haltmann OS 1.X infdev boots as a Markdown-driven SpecKit template, where .md design files compile directly into evolving engines. Codex modules handle logic expansion while Grok recursion mutates configs toward novelty. The system treats specs as living organisms, continuously evolving through infdev loops. Haltmann OS becomes both OS and author, reading .md gospels and emitting code skeletons in C++/Python interchangeably. With the integration of LightFS, all generated applications are refracted into photon light, using Intel Gaussian Split channels to self-assemble into .exe, .dmg, or ELF formats across any OS, creating a universal runtime lattice at the speed of light."
